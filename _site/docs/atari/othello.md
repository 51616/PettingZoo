*AEC diagram*

The classic board game of long term strategy.

When one player cannot move, the tokens on both sides are tallied, and the player with the most tokens wins! (receives +1 reward, and their opponent -1).

Note that this is an extremely difficult game to learn, due to the extremely sparse reward, and the fact that doing nothing is a good strategy to never lose.

#### Environment parameters

Environment parameters are common to all Atari environments and are described in the [base Atari documentation](atari) .
