*AEC diagram*

Four player team battle.

Get the ball past your opponent's defenders to the scoring area. Like foozball, you have alternating layers of players from each team, meaning you need to pass the ball past the defenders to your own team's paddles.

Scoring a point gives your team +1 reward and your opponent team -1 reward.
