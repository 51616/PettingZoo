*AEC diagram*

A competitive game of positioning and prediction.

Goal: Get the ball past your opponent. Don't let the ball get past you.

When a point is scored (by the ball exiting the area), you get +1 reward and your opponent gets -1 reward. Unlike normal tennis matches, the number of games won is not directly rewarded. 

#### Environment parameters

Environment parameters are common to all Atari environments and are described in the [base Atari documentation](../atari.md) .
