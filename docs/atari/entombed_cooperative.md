*AEC diagram*


Entomb's cooperative version is an exploration game
where you need to work with your teammate to make it
as far as possible into the maze.

You both need to quickly navigate down a constantly generating
maze you can only see part of. If you get stuck, you lose.
Note you can easily find yourself in a dead-end excapable only through the use of rare power-ups.
If players help each other by the use of these powerups, they can last longer.
In addition, there dangerous zombies lurking around to avoid.
