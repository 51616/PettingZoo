*AEC diagram*


Entomb's competitive version is a race to last the longest.

You need to quickly navigate down a constantly generating
maze you can only see part of. If you get stuck, you lose.
Note you can easily find yourself in a dead-end excapable only through the use of rare power-ups.
In addition, there dangerous zombies lurking around to avoid.
Whenever your opponent dies, you get +1 reward, and your opponent gets -1 reward.
