*AEC diagram*

In this environment, a single agent sees landmark position, and is rewarded based on how close it gets to landmark (Euclidian distance). This is not a multiagent environment, and is primarily intended for debugging purposes.

Observation space: `[self_vel, landmark_rel_position]`

```
simple.env(seed=None, max_frames=100)
```

```
seed: seed for random values. Set to None to use machine random source. Set to fixed value for deterministic behavior

max_frames: number of frames (a step for each agent) until game terminates
```
